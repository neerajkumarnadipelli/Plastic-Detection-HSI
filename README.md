# Plastic Detection in Hyperspectral Images

## üìò Overview

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a powerful remote sensing technique to detect plastic waste due to the unique spectral signatures of materials.  
However, the absence of pixel-level ground truth for plastic materials makes real-world validation difficult.

To overcome this, we:
- Generated synthetic hyperspectral data using known plastic spectral signatures.
- Benchmarked spectral unmixing algorithms like FCLS, NNLS, KHype, NMF, ElasticNet, LASSO, UCLS, Pseudo-Inverse.
- Applied top-performing models to real AVIRIS hyperspectral imagery from four Indian coastal regions.
